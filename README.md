# aws-sdk-go-v2-ifaces

To provide a more idiomatic interface to the AWS SDK for Go v2 since AWS refuses to do so.

Eventually this will include mocks as well via mockery.

## Local Development

- npm i (installs node and go dependencies)
- npm run sync (clones repo aws-sdk-go-v2 to ./tmp/aws-sdk-go-v2, then greps interfaces)
