# Overrides Directory

This directory contains files that override default configurations or behaviors in the main application. These overrides can be used to customize functionality without modifying the core codebase. These files are typically loaded after the default settings, allowing them to take precedence.

This is a temporary / hack solution to deal with AWS SDK not being uniform across some services. Once AWS SDK is updated to a uniform patterns across specific services, these overrides can be removed.
